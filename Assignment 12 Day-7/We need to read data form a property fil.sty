We need to read data form a property file named messages.properties

sample data in the file

key:message

101:success

102:information

103:error

104:servererror



Write down the steps to read the file contents in java program (along with the API names, class, methods can we used) 
To read the contents of a property file named "messages.properties" in a Java program, you can use the following steps:

First, you need to import the java.util.Properties class, which provides useful methods for working with property files.

import java.util.Properties;
Next, you can create a new instance of the Properties class, which will be used to load the property file.
Copy code
Properties props = new Properties();
You can use the Properties.load() method to load the contents of the property file into the Properties instance. This method takes an InputStream object as its argument, so you will need to use the ClassLoader class to get an InputStream that points to the property file.

InputStream inputStream = getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("messages.properties");
props.load(inputStream);
Once the property file has been loaded, you can use the Properties.getProperty() method to read the value of a specific property. For example, to get the value of the "101" property, you can use the following code:

String value = props.getProperty("101");
You can also use the Properties.keySet() method to get a Set containing all the keys in the property file, and then iterate over this set to read all the properties in the file.

Set<String> keys = props.keySet();
for (String key : keys) {
  String value = props.getProperty(key);
  // do something with the key and value
}
Finally, don't forget to close the InputStream when you are done reading the property file, to free up any resources that it was using.
Copy code
inputStream.close();
