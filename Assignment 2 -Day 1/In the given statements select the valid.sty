Q .In the given statements select the valid main method statement.
explain the meaning of each word in the main method 
eg : what public  or what private  or what is void 
A. private static void main (String arg[])
B. protected static void main (String arg[])
C. public static void Main(String arg[])
D. public static void main(String []arg)

The valid main method statement is option 
D, public static void main(String []arg).

public: This is an access modifier that indicates that 
the method can be accessed by any code in any class.
static: This means that the method belongs to the class itself,
 rather than to a specific object of the class. 
This allows the method to be called without creating an instance 
of the class.
void: This indicates that the method does not return a value.
main: This is the name of the method. In Java, the main method is 
the entry point of a program and is where the program starts 
executing.
(String []arg): This is the method signature. It specifies 
the data type of the parameter that the method accepts 
(in this case, an array of strings), as well as the name of the parameter (arg).



Q.Identify Valid access modifiers for the given class 

A. class  Test

{

}

B. public class Test

{

}

C. protected class Test

{

}

D. private class Test

{

}
Valid access modifiers for the given class are 
options B and D, public class Test and private class Test.

In Java, a class can have an access modifier that determines 
which other classes can access it. The possible access modifiers are:

public: This means that the class can be accessed by any code in any class.
protected: This means that the class can only be accessed by code in the same 
package or by subclasses of the class.
private: This means that the class can only be accessed by code in the same class.
No access modifier: This means that the class can only be accessed by code in 
the same package.
In the given options, only options B and D include valid access modifiers for 
the class. Option A does not include an access modifier, so the class can only 
be accessed by code in the same package. Option C includes the protected access 
modifier, 
but this is not a valid access modifier for a class.
